"""Policy module: test the policy layer guardrails.

Stage 2 adds a policy layer that enforces three checkpoints:
1. check_input: scrub PII (card numbers) and flag injection attempts
2. guarded_run: enforce cross-tool rules (one escalation per conversation,
               confirmation gate for destructive actions)
3. check_output: verify all identifiers in the reply came from tools

Tests pin:
- PII scrubbing removes card numbers but preserves order numbers
- Injection attempts are flagged
- One escalation per conversation is enforced
- Confirmation gate requires a separate turn for confirmation
- Unverified identifiers in replies are redacted
