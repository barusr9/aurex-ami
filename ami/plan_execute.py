"""The second planner: PLAN-AND-EXECUTE.

ReAct decides one step at a time — think, act, look, think again. Each
look costs a full model call with the whole transcript attached.

Plan-and-execute makes two calls, no matter how many tools run:

    1. PLAN     the model writes the entire list of tool calls up front
    2. EXECUTE  plain Python runs them in order — no model in the loop
    3. ANSWER   one final call turns the observations into a reply

Cheaper and faster when the path is predictable. Worse when it is not:
the planner cannot know an order number it has not looked up yet, so a
step that depends on an earlier result has to be left blank ("?") and the
whole thing re-planned once the blank can be filled. That re-plan is the
honest cost of planning ahead, and the trace shows it.

HOW YOU PLAN
You plan the whole task before acting, then act, then answer.
- When asked to plan, list every tool call needed, in order. Give the
  reason for each. If a later step needs a value you do not have yet
  (an order number you have not looked up), write "?" for that argument;
  you will be asked to re-plan once it is known.
- Plan the fewest steps that finish the job. Do not plan lookups you
  do not need.
- When asked to answer, use only what the observations say.
