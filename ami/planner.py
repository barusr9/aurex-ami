"""Element 3 of the agent: PLANNING — the ReAct loop.

ReAct = Reason + Act. The agent works in a visible cycle:

    Thought:      what do I know, what do I need next, why this tool
    Action:       the tool call
    Observation:  what came back

...repeated until it has enough to answer. The baseline loop in agent.py
does the same Action/Observation dance, but the Thought is hidden inside
the model. Here we force it into the open by making "thought" a REQUIRED
argument on every tool.

That one change buys three things:
  - you can read why the agent did what it did (debugging)
  - the model plans before it acts instead of after (better tool choice)
  - a bad plan is visible in the trace, not buried in a wrong answer

HOW YOU PLAN
Work one step at a time, and think before each step.
- Before every tool call, state your reasoning in the 'thought' argument:
  what you already know, what is still missing, and why this tool is next.
- Take ONE action at a time. Read the observation before deciding again.
- Errors come in two kinds, and they are handled differently:
  * "retry": true  -> YOU called the tool wrongly. Fix the arguments and
    call it again. Do not tell the customer about this.
  * no retry flag  -> a POLICY refusal. Never repeat the call. Tell the
    customer the rule and offer their next option.
- Stop as soon as you can answer. Do not call tools you do not need.
